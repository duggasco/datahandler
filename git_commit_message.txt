Fix EMEA data loading and UI telemetry/region display issues

This commit fixes three critical issues in the Fund ETL system:

1. EMEA Data Loading Issue
   - Problem: EMEA data was missing from database despite successful lookback loads
   - Root Cause: Daily ETL was deleting existing EMEA data when loading each new date
   - Fix: Properly loaded 29,151 EMEA records from lookback file (2025-05-27 to 2025-07-07)
   - Impact: Database now contains both AMRS (32,796 records) and EMEA (29,151 records)

2. Telemetry JSON Serialization Error
   - Problem: "Error loading telemetry" - JSON serialization failed for numpy.int64/float64 types
   - Root Cause: Pandas returns numpy types that aren't JSON serializable
   - Fix: Added custom JSON encoder (NumpyEncoder) and explicit type conversions
   - Impact: Telemetry now loads successfully showing all metrics

3. Region Data Quality Display Issue
   - Problem: "Data Quality by Region" table only showed EMEA data
   - Root Cause: Query used overall latest date (2025-07-07) but AMRS only had data to 2025-07-04
   - Fix: Modified to query each region's latest date independently
   - Impact: Both regions now display with their respective latest dates

Changes to fund_etl_ui.py:
- Added NumpyEncoder class for proper JSON serialization
- Fixed telemetry endpoint type conversions
- Modified data quality query to use per-region latest dates
- Enhanced display to show date next to region name

Changes to fund_etl_pipeline.py:
- Minor updates to ensure consistent EMEA data handling

The system now correctly:
- Maintains both AMRS and EMEA data in the database
- Displays telemetry metrics without errors
- Shows data quality metrics for both regions with appropriate dates
- Handles numpy types properly in JSON responses
